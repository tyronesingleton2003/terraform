    - Terraform Providers:
        - Plugins for providers are downloaded when using terraform init
        - Are a part of a plugin architecture, used by Terraform
        - Distributed by HashiCorp and publicy available at registry.terraform.io
        - Downloaded in a hidden directory (.terraform)

    - Terraform Provider Tiers:
        - Official
        - Partner
        - Community
    
    -  The plugin name is also known as the source address.  It is comprised of the following:
        - Organizational Namespace
        - Resource Type
        - Hostname (source of resource. This is optional)

    - Configuration Directory:
        - Single configuration file to create the infrastructure/resources
        - main.tf - main configuration file containing resource definition
        - variables.tf - contains variable declarations
        - outpus.tf - Contains output from resources
        - providers.tf - contains provider definitions

    - Variables:
        - Contained in variables.tf file
        - Is defined by the 'variable' keyword
        - Should generally be named as value being filled
        - when using in the resource block, fill in the argument what 'var.variable_name'
        - Variable parameters:
            default - defines the value of the variable
            type - defines the type of the variable being defined
                string
                boolean
                number
                list
                map
                object
                set - list with no duplicates
                tuple - different, but exact
                any
            description - gives description of variable

    - Variable Usage:
        - Not having a default for the variable will cause terraform to prompt for input
        - Using the '-var' on the command line will allow for inline variables
        - Variables can be exported using the "export TF_VAR_<var_name>" command.
        - Variables can be automatically applied automatically using the variable.auto.tfvars file
        - Variables can be stored in the terraform.tfvars file (similiar to Ansible vars file) 
        - Variables can be applied using the 'terraform apply -var-file variables.tfvars' command.

    - Dependencies:
        - Implicit dependencies are automatically inferred by Terraform when one resource references another using interpolation syntax. Terraform analyzes these references to determine the order of resource creation.
        - Explicit dependencies are defined using the depends_on argument when Terraform cannot infer the relationship between resources. This is useful when dependencies are not directly visible in the resource attributes.

    - Output:
        - Terraform allows output from a resource block using the 'output' keyword.
        - The parameters for the output block are "value" and "description"
        - The output is viewed using 'terraform output'.
        - Best use is for input to share output on screen or input for another IAC tool
